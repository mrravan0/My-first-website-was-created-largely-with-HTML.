                    9 September [O.S. 28 August] 1828 – 20 November [O.S. 7 November]
                    1910, usually referred to in English as Leo Tolstoy, was a Russian writer. He is regarded as one of
                    the
                    greatest and most influential authors of all time. He received nominations for the Nobel Prize in
                    Literature every year from 1902 to 1906 and for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1901, 1902, and 1909.

                    <br><br>
                    Born into an aristocratic family, Tolstoy's notable works include the novels War and Peace (1869)
                    and
                    Anna
                    Karenina (1878),[5] often cited as pinnacles of realist fiction,[2] and two of the greatest books of
                    all
                    time.[3][4] He first achieved literary acclaim in his twenties with his semi-autobiographical
                    trilogy,
                    Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852–1856), and Sevastopol Sketches (1855), based upon his
                    experiences in
                    the
                    Crimean War. His fiction includes dozens of short stories such as
                    <strong>
                        "After the Ball" (1911), and several
                        novellas such as The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886), Family Happiness (1859) and Hadji Murad
                        (1912).
                    </strong>
                    He also wrote plays and essays concerning philosophical, moral and religious themes

                    <br><br>
                    In the 1870s, Tolstoy experienced a profound moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as an
                    equally
                    profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work Confession (1882). His literal
                    interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him
                    to
                    become
                    a fervent Christian anarchist and pacifist.[2] His ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such
                    works
                    as The Kingdom of God Is Within You (1894), had a profound impact on such pivotal 20th-century
                    figures
                    as
                    Mahatma Gandhi,[6] Martin Luther King Jr.,[7] James Bevel,[8] and Ludwig Wittgenstein.[9] He also
                    became
                    a
                    dedicated advocate of Georgism, the economic philosophy of Henry George, which he incorporated into
                    his
                    writing, particularly in his novel Resurrection (1899).

                    <br> <br>
                    Tolstoy received praise from countless authors and critics, both during his lifetime and after.
                    Virginia
                    Woolf called Tolstoy "the greatest of all novelists",[10] and Gary Saul Morson referred to War and
                    Peace
                    as
                    the greatest of all novels.[11] Tolstoy never having won a Nobel Prize was a major Nobel Prize
                    controversy,

                    a family estate 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) southwest of Tula, and 200
                    kilometres (120 mi) south of Moscow. He was the fourth of five children of Count Nikolai Ilyich
                    Tolstoy
                    (1794–1837), a veteran of the Patriotic War of 1812, and Princess Mariya Tolstaya (née Volkonskaya;
                    1790–1830). His mother died when he was two and his father when he was nine.[21] Tolstoy and his
                    siblings
                    were brought up by relatives. In 1844, he began studying law and oriental languages at Kazan
                    University,
                    where teachers described him as "both unable and unwilling to learn".

                    <br><br>
                    Tolstoy left the university in
                    the
                    middle of his studies,returned to Yasnaya Polyana and then spent much time in Moscow, Tula and
                    Saint
                    Petersburg, leading a lax and leisurely lifestyle. He began writing during this period, including
                    his
                    first novel Childhood, a fictitious account of his own youth, which was published in 1852.In 1851,
                    after
                    running up heavy gambling debts, he went with his older brother to the Caucasus and joined the army.

                    <br><br>
                    Tolstoy
                    served as a young artillery officer during the Crimean War and was in Sevastopol during the
                    11-month-long
                    siege of Sevastopol in 1854–55, including the Battle of the Chernaya. During the war he was
                    recognised
                    for his courage and promoted to lieutenant. He was appalled by the number of deaths involved in
                    warfare,[21] and left the army after the end of the Crimean War.

                    His experience in the army, and two trips around Europe in 1857 and 1860–61 converted Tolstoy from a
                    dissolute and privileged society author to a non-violent and spiritual anarchist. Others who
                    followed
                    the
                    same path were Alexander Herzen, Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin. During his 1857 visit, Tolstoy
                    witnessed a public execution in Paris, a traumatic experience that marked the rest of his life. In a
                    letter
                    to his friend Vasily Botkin, Tolstoy wrote: "The truth is that the State is a conspiracy designed
                    not
                    only
                    to exploit, but above all to corrupt its citizens ... Henceforth, I shall never serve any government
                    anywhere."

                    <br><br>
                    Tolstoy's concept of non-violence or ahimsa was bolstered when he read a German version
                    of
                    the Tirukkural. He later instilled the concept in Mahatma Gandhi through his "A Letter to a
                    Hindu"
                    when young Gandhi corresponded with him seeking his advice.
